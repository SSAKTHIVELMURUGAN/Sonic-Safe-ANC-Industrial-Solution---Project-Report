Problem Statement
In industrial settings, persistent noise generated by machinery and operations poses a significant threat to worker health and productivity. Exposure to high noise levels increases stress, anxiety, and the risk of chronic health conditions, such as high blood pressure. Moreover, it disrupts sleep patterns, leading to fatigue and reduced efficiency. Effective communication among workers is also hampered, resulting in potential accidents and decreased productivity. Overall, the quality of life for industrial workers is greatly compromised by this pervasive issue of noise pollution.

Abstract
The "Professional Noise Guard" project aims to address the adverse effects of persistent noise pollution in industrial environments on worker well-being and productivity. Leveraging Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) technology and the NRF24L01+PA+LNA wireless module, our solution provides an innovative approach to reducing ambient noise levels and creating a safer, more conducive work environment.

Sensitive microphones strategically positioned in the workplace capture environmental noise, which is then processed through a dedicated circuit to generate precise "anti-noise" signals. These anti-noise signals, when combined with the original audio, effectively neutralize the noise, resulting in a quieter work environment.

By implementing ANC technology and integrating wireless communication capabilities, our solution aims to significantly reduce noise levels in real-time, thereby enhancing worker well-being, communication, and overall productivity. Ultimately, the "Professional Noise Guard" project seeks to revolutionize noise management in industrial settings, contributing to a safer and more productive industrial landscape.
